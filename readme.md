#Arduino Object Oriented Programming
A short sample code on how to define classes and instantiate objects with the Arduino development board


This is a **quick and dirty sample sketch** for the Arduino which I made for myself in order to remember how to make objects using C/C++ syntax easily.
The goal of the project is to make my own code more readeable, stuctured and easier to maintain.

## Features
- the Arduino can treat it's PINs as objects
- classes and it's methods can be stored in separated .h files (typical C syntax)

## Good to know
It's a good idea to make classes for every real-life objects such as the LCD screen, LEDs, servo, etc. Use your imagination!
